# Spiral Betty
Convert your images into spirals [spiralbetty.com](spiralbetty.com)
- Upload an image or try demo image
- Crop, scale, and move image in circle
- Spiralize, edit, and download

## Background
I made this site purely for fun.

If you make a spiral using this app be sure to tag @SpiralBetty on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spiralbetty) or [Instgram](https://www.instagram.com/spiralbetty/).


Spiral Betty was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Possible roadmap
- Do several refactoring passes
- Change to react hooks
- Splash screen addition

## GH-PAGES deploy:
- Make sure master is up-to-date and pushed
- Run `npm run deploy`
  - If you want you can customize the commit message to `gh-pages` you can in `package.json`
- After deploying don't forget to `npm i`
